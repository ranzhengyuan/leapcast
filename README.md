# leapcast (deprecated)

This project no longer works because Google locked down entire API. There are alternatives like cloning device, casting apk from nexus player etc. Thanks for all contibutors and I hope we all learned something from this project. Meanwhile I'am keeping https://github.com/dz0ny/leapcast/issues/130 open if anyone wants to discuss something related to lepacast or 2nd screen paradigm.

I would love to re-implement this as an open source alternative to chromecast someday, but I won't make any promises.

Have fun :)
